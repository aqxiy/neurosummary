neuroscience gleanings (from neurorecovery journey)


The paradox of open mindedness is effectively the basis of human thought and cognition

Whether you like or accept something is quantum and person path defining

Brain routes around memory encoding; Traces access points of problems throughput recursively to advance

Structured, nested, iterative (as in iterating on prior thought) decision making and learning is how people work; a possibly quantum process

Cerebellar involvement in combined words of sentences for composite meaning

Effective & safe neural mesh injection requires spatiotemporally variable youngs modulus configuration

Callbacks + multilayer perceptron == multipurpose AGI

There are things you have intuition for, and things you need to experiment with to understand. Closed feedback loop.

Renovate == undirected improvement without converted effort

Exception == in avoidance of

ok theory time

BECAUSE TREESORT.PY works differently on ARM and X86 fundamentally and this interfaces with electronics on some low level

AND there is this theory of 3d electron interference 

Audio wireless will work better with one system and wired with the other

And for some reason ARM is for wireless

Superscalar ARM

SO THIS WAS MY FIRST INDUCTION PROOF

Life is about optimizing; finding the minimal path, pointing to targets; this routes thoughts. The routes we take define us.

The impossible proof

The electronic space is between 2 and 3 D

Light is Quasi-1D
